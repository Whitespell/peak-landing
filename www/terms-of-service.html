</li>
<li>Dispute Resolution<br>
If you have a dispute of any kind with UPFIT, you agree to first contact us to attempt to resolve it informally and in good faith.  If this is not successful, you agree that all disputes between you and UPFIT in connection with this Agreement or the Service (including disputes that may involve a third party, but not including claims only for injunctive or other equitable relief) will be resolved by binding arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer related disputes.  You may only bring a claim covered by this Agreement in your individual capacity, and not as part of any class action or class-wide or consolidated arbitration.  No arbitrator may consolidate more than one claim covered by this agreement unless UPFIT specifically agrees to such consolidation.  You agree that, by using the Service and agreeing to these terms, you and UPFIT are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdictions.  Contrary provisions of applicable law notwithstanding, no arbitrator of any dispute covered by this Agreement will have the authority to award damages, remedies or award that conflict with the Terms of Service.</li>
<li>Governing Law<br>
This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its law regarding choice of law.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive venue and jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Dade County, Florida in the event of any lawsuits, claims or other disputes relating to or arising from this Agreement that are not subject to arbitration.  The Service is provided in the United States, and is not intended for use in any jurisdiction where such use would contrary to applicable law or regulation, or would subject UPFIT to any registration requirement in such jurisdiction.</li>
<li>
	General
	<ol>
	<li>This Agreement, and all rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by UPFIT without restriction.  Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be null and void.</li>
	<li>This Agreement constitutes the full and complete agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior contracts or agreements between the Parties, whether oral or written.</li>
	<li>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed unenforceable, and in all other respects this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; provided that if any such provision may be made enforceable by limitation thereof, then such provision shall be deemed to be so limited and shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</li>
	<li>The failure of UPFIT to insist upon strict performance of a covenant hereunder or of any obligation hereunder, irrespective of the length of time for which such failure continues, shall not be a waiver of UPFIT’ right to demand strict compliance in the future.</li>
	<li>No consent or waiver, express or implied, to or of any breach or default in the performance of any obligation hereunder shall constitute a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance of the same or any other obligation hereunder.</li>
	<li>You must commence any cause of action arising out of or in any way related to the Service or these Terms of Service within one (1) year after such cause of action accrues, or such cause of action shall be barred, without regard to any other limitations period set forth by law or statute.</li>
